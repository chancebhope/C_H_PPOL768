write a two-paragraph biography of yourself, including your program, your level of experience with Stata, GitHub, and SurveyCTO, and some other basic biographical information of your choice. 
My name is Chance Hope, and I am a second year MPP student. I am originally from Palm Desert, California, and I went to UC Santa Barbara for undergrad. As a policy student, I have a strong interest in energy, transportation, and health policy. After this program, I am planning to stay in the DC area. 
I am proficient in stata, having recently used it in multiple core classes. I am also familiar with github, although I had not used it in quite some time until now. I have no experience with SurveyCTO, and look forward to learning more about it. I am hoping to apply the technical competencies that I develop during this course to an analytic role.
